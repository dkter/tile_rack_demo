This is a small proof of concept app demonstrating how to draw/render a Scrabble-style tile rack. This uses [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) as a graphics library. To build and run the app, simply `cargo run`.

If you're a nerd like me, you can also use this with any word you want to help you find anagrams or whatever: `tile_rack_demo <WORD>`
